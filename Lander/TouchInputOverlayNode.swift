//
//  The technique for getting touch input on a scene overlay
//  and delegating to widgets was inspired by the DemoBots sample project
//  available from Apple at https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/DemoBots/Introduction/Intro.html
//
//  Specifically their technique for handling multitouch was very helpful
//  The most relevant class in that sample project is TouchControlInputNode
