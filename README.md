# Lander

Final project for CSC 391 iOS App Development II

## Goals

The primary goal of this project is to implement a physics based 2D spaceship game using the SpriteKit and Core Motion frameworks.

Players will guide the Lander on an Apollo style Lunar landing. The game starts with a de-orbit burn after which the player must manage their fuel and velocity to land the craft safely on the Lunar surface.

## Building the app

This app is being developed using Xcode 9.3.1 and targeting iOS 11.

It is often tested on an iPhone 6 with (usually) working motion sensors. It is occasionally tested on an iPhone 7 with much better behaved motion sensors.
